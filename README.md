### 🩺 Project: Lung Cancer Detection using CNNs

#### 🧬 Overview
**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are a type of **deep learning model** that excel at analyzing visual data.  
In this project, CNNs are applied to **CT scan images** to automatically learn and extract meaningful features that distinguish **cancerous** from **non-cancerous lung tissues**.  
This approach enables **early and accurate detection** of lung cancer — a crucial factor in improving patient outcomes.

#### 🎯 Objective
- Develop a CNN model capable of classifying CT scans as **cancerous** or **non-cancerous**.  
- Automate the **feature extraction process** using deep learning techniques.  
- Improve the **accuracy and reliability** of early lung cancer diagnosis.

#### 🧩 Key Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation for medical CT images  
- Implementation of CNN architectures (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, or a custom CNN)  
- Model training, evaluation, and visualization of results  
- Comparative analysis with traditional machine learning methods  

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Git  
- **Dataset:** Public lung CT scan datasets (e.g., LIDC-IDRI or Kaggle Lung Cancer Dataset)

---

### 📊 Results
- Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous CT scans.  
- Demonstrated the potential of CNN-based systems for **automated lung cancer screening**.  
- Visualized feature maps and activation layers to interpret the model’s decision-making process.

---

### 🚀 Future Work
- Integrate explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance model transparency.  
- Extend the model to detect and classify other lung diseases.  
- Develop a web-based or mobile diagnostic support tool for medical professionals.
